comman: `qmk flash -kb fr/corne -km default -bl avrdude-split-left`
and replace the split left to right when flashing for the right keyboard half

How to flash the firmware- hold the first key(the switch that is in the thumb cluster and isn't under any of the rows)
while the microcontroller is booting(right after plugging it in)
